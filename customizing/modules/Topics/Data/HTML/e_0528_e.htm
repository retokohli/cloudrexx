<b>Cost averaging</b><BR><BR>
Strategic exploitation of price fluctuations. This method of investing takes advantage of regular payments. The investor invests the same amount every month, and thus acquires more units when the issue price is lower and less units when it is higher. Over the long term, the investor thus attains a more favourable cost price than with the regular purchase of a fixed number of units over the same period of time.
