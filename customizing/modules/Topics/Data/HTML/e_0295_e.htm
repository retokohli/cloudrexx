<b>Guarantee fund</b><BR><BR>
A guarantee fund is a fund based on public law. Its function is to pay subsidies to <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(391)'>occupational pension plans </A>where the age structure is disadvantageous. In addition, it guarantees the legal benefits due if a pension plan becomes insolvent. Guarantee funds are financed by the pension plans. The share of each institution is determined by the sum of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(206)'>coordinated salaries</A> of all the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured persons</A> paying their contributions towards an old-age pension.
