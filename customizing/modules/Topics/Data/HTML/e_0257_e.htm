<b>Partial premium payments (paid-up component)</b><BR><BR>
An <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>insured capital sum</A> may consist of one part where premiums are not paid and one part with periodic payment of premiums. For the former, the customer pays no premiums; the paid-up part was either set up with a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium</A> paid at the commencement of the insurance contract or during the term of the contract as a result of a change to the contract (e.g. reduction of the sum insured).
