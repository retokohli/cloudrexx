<b>Insurence by special agreement</b><BR><BR>
Within the context of accident insurance law, an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> may offer an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A> the possibility of extending cover against non-professional accidents by special agreement. The aim of this is to maintain cover when compulsory insurance comes to an end.
