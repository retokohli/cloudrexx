<b>Recourse</b><BR><BR>
The question about the right of recourse arises if two or more persons are liable to provide compensation for the same <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>damage</A>, mainly for different legal reasons. For example, this is the case if a third party causes damage to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A> for which the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> is responsible for providing compensation under the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A>. The question is, if the insurer has compensated the injured party for the damage, under what circumstances the insurer can obtain reimbursement for the compensation paid from the person who caused the damage. The rules on recourse are in accordance with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A> 72 (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(747)'>subrogation</A>) and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(439)'>CO</A> 51. If the person who caused the damage did so culpably while committing an unlawful act, the insurer has the right of recourse (VVG/LCA 72). If the person who caused the damage is only liable to the injured party under the contract, as is the insurer, the insurer only has the right of recourse in the case of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(160)'>gross negligence</A> (OR/CO 51). Recourse may not be applied in the case of personal fixed sum insurances, for which the principle of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(738)'>cumulation</A> is applicable.
