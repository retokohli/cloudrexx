<b>System covering military disability payments</b><BR><BR>
The system covering military disability payments (EO/APG), in force since 1 January 1953, deals with benefit payments for disability as a result of military service or civil defence activities. Those persons contributing to the Swiss army or to the civil defence have the right to such indemnities. The EO/APG guarantees the following benefits: household indemnities, indemnities for persons living alone, child benefits, guardian's allowances and business allowances.
