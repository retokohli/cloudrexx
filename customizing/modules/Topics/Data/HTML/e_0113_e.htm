<b>Life insurance </b><BR><BR>
In the context of life insurance, the agreed capital sum matures if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> is still alive at a predetermined date. However, hardly any such pure products are still in existence. As a general rule, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(261)'>premium refund</A> is included in a contract. This means that in the event of death, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> paid are totally or partially refunded to the beneficiaries (without interest). Since life insurance has no risk cover, the insurance company may not request a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(155)'>medical examination</A>. This is the reason why this form of insurance is particularly suitable in cases where, for medical reasons, any other type of life insurance cannot be envisaged. Life insurance may be considered as a kind of investment, particularly when it is financed by a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium.</A> A safe and effective method of building up a capital sum is to combine periodic premiums with a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(255)'>premium payment waiver</A> in the event of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>disability.</A>
