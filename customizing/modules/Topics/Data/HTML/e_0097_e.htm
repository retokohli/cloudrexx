<b>Age at entry</b><BR><BR>
The age at entry is a deciding factor in the calculation of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> when a life insurance contract is being drawn up. It corresponds to the difference between the commencement date of the insurance and the date of birth of the prospective <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A>. Age at entry is expressed in whole years with fractions over six months being rounded up to the greater whole year.
