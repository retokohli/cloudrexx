<b>Reinsurance</b><BR><BR>
The aim of reinsurance is to spread a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(278)'>risk</A> between a direct insurer and a reinsurer based on a certain percentage. An <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> who issues a contract to a customer is referred to as a "direct insurer". By passing on part of the business to a reinsurer, he acts as an assignor whilst the reinsurer who accepts the risk becomes an assignee. That part of the risk that the first insurer bears is called the "retention" and that part which he passes on the "second risk".
