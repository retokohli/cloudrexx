<b>Disability, invalidity</b><BR><BR>
The notion of disability is normally assimilated with the idea of "incapacity to earn one's living". Strictly speaking, disability implies that a person's health is wholly or partially affected as a result of illness or an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(336)'>accident</A>, so that it is not necessarily linked to an incapacity to earn. In the field of life insurance, a distinction is made between temporary and permanent <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>disability.</A> An insurance company must, therefore, only provide a benefit if, following an illness or accident, there is a reduction in income resulting from the illness or accident and if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> is incapable of exercising his occupation or some other activity corresponding to his social situation.
