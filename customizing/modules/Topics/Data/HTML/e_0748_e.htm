<b>Withdrawal</b><BR><BR>
Withdrawal from the contract should not be confused with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(739)'>termination</A>. A termination dissolves the contractual relationship in perpetuity, while a withdrawal effects the dissolution of the contractual relationship retroactively to a specific point in time. The consequence of withdrawal is that the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> can request reimbursement of benefits which were indemnified subsequent to the existence of the reason for withdrawal. Examples include withdrawal as a result of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(23)'>breach of the duty of disclosure</A> or fraudulent substantiation of a claim.
