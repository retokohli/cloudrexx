<b>Theor. yield to maturity (net), bond a. money m. f.</b><BR><BR>
The theoretical yield-to-maturity figures published for <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(620)'>bond funds</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(565)'>money market funds</A> represent the yield expected for the next 12 months based on the current fund portfolio. This yield is an estimate and corresponds to the weighted average yield to maturity on all the funds investments. In the process, the funds own administrative costs are calculated and subtracted from the gross yield to maturity. The theoretical yield to maturity is also affected by changes in the composition of the portfolio and fluctuations in interest rates. In other words, no conclusions can be drawn from a funds yield to maturity concerning a possible <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(489)'>distribution</A>. <BR>
