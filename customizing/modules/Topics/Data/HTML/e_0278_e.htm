<b>Risk</b><BR><BR>
The notion of risk covers the likelihood that a particular event might happen resulting in <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>damages</A> or creating a personal need. In this respect, the occurrence of such an event is uncertain and fortuitous. If the probability of occurrence of the event and the amount of any claim cannot be influenced by those participating in the insurance, the term objective risk is used. If, on the other hand, relevant facts are a result of the behaviour of persons participating in the insurance - in particular if the occurrence of the event and the amount of the claim can be influenced by parties connected with the claim -, then the term subjective risk is used.
