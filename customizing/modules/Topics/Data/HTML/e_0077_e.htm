<b>Provisional risk cover</b><BR><BR>
Provisional or interim cover exists if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> provides <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(372)'>insurance cover</A> before confirming acceptance of the submitted insurance application. As a general rule, interim cover has the same scope as the submitted <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(20)'>application</A>. It is subject to a regular time limit and normally lapses on acceptance or rejection of the application by the insurer. According to current doctrine, interim cover forms an independent <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A> which is not bound to any form.
