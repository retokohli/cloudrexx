<b>Social insurance </b><BR><BR>
Compulsory personal insurance with insurance benefits that are set by law. The purpose of social insurance is to provide basic protection for the financial consequences of the risks of old age, death, illness, accident, disability, unemployment, military service obligations and maternity. The social nature of the insurance is reflected, in particular, in the solidarity principle and in the legal entitlement to it. The insurance can cover the entire resident population (e.g. AHV/IV) or a limited group of people (e.g. UVG, EO).
