<b>Exclusion</b><BR><BR>
Based on the principle that "that which is not specifically excluded from an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(358)'>insurance</A> is considered to be included", all exclusions are mentioned in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract </A>in as detailed a way as possible in order to remove any doubt as to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A>'s obligation to provide benefits if a claim is made.
