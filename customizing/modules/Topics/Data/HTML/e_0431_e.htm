<b>Fiduciary transaction</b><BR><BR>
Transaction that a fiduciary (trustee), often a bank, undertakes under its own name but under the instructions and at the risks and perils of the trustor. For instance, a fiduciary may accept a trustor's capital and, on the trustor's instructions, invest it in his own name with a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(86)'>third party</A>. The trustor, however, bears all risks connected with the investment.
