<b>Death risk insurance</b><BR><BR>
If an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person </A>dies before the contracted <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(105)'>term</A> of an insurance, the insurance company pays out an agreed capital sum. If the insured person is still alive at term, no benefit is payable. As opposed to an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(150)'>endowment insurance</A>, this type of insurance contains no savings element and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> is correspondingly lower. It serves above all to provide a capital sum in the event of death. If the insured capital sum remains constant throughout the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(379)'>duration of the contract</A>, the insurance is referred to as level term insurance. This is the most common form of risk insurance. It serves essentially to protect a family against the death of the insured person but it can also be used as a guarantee for a debt. If such a debt needs to be paid off each year, it can be arranged for the risk cover to be reduced by a fixed amount. With declining term insurance, the capital sum agreed in the course of the first year of the insurance decreases by an agreed amount over the duration of the contract. Should the insured person die before the term of the insurance, the insured capital sum remaining at the moment of death is distributed to the beneficiaries. If the insured person is still alive at term, no benefit is paid out. Death risk insurance policies of this type are often used to cover a second-level mortgage that has to be paid off. The insured benefits are reduced each year and, since the insurer's risk is small, the premiums become very attractive. This is also the reason why declining term insurance is particularly convenient for those who need high insurance cover for a short period but are only able to pay modest premiums. Combined with an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(43)'>endowment insurance</A>, this type of insurance provides cover for what is needed with reasonable premiums and a guaranteed benefit on survival to maturity of the policy allowing all of the premiums paid to be recuperated.
