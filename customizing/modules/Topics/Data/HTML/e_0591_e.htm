<b>Correlation</b><BR><BR>
A measure of the degree to which the price trends of various investment categories or instruments move in the same direction. The correlation quantifies the strength of the relationship as a figure between -1 and +1. The closer the coefficient is to 1, the stronger the correlation. If the coefficient is -1, the investments and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(494)'>benchmark</A> move in opposite directions. If the value is 0 there is no correlation.
