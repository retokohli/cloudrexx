<b>Duty to due care and attention</b><BR><BR>
The Swiss Civil Code is based on the principle that each individual can expect other persons to display due care and attention. Hence, all <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholders</A> are expected to show such care and attention. A person who willingly ignores the rules of damage sprevention exposes himself to a reduction in <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A>. If a person causes<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'> damages</A> through not having applied due care and attention, he is said to show a lack of duty to due care and attention.
