<b>Interim profit taxation (Zwischengewinnbest.)</b><BR><BR>
German finance authorities observed that many investors regularly sold their fund units prior to the year-end of the fund, in order to avoid taxation of earnings (considered a tax-free capital gain). German lawmakers therefore introduced the so-called interim gains tax on 1 January 1994. With each sale or redemption of units of foreign funds, the interest accrued until that date is taxed (does not apply to dividends). The sale or redemption of units before the end of the fundÂ’s financial year thus no longer allows investors to make tax-free gains.
