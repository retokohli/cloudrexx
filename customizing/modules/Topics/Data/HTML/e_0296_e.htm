<b>Security fund</b><BR><BR>
When they enter into business, life insurance companies are required to deposit a guarantee of SFr. 500,000. This sum is placed in a safety fund covering the rights of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholders</A> of life insurance contracts which they have issued. The ideal sum corresponds to the technical reserves of a life insurance company.
