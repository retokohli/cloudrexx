<b>Fund-linked life insurance</b><BR><BR>
In the case of fund-linked life insurance, the portion of insurance contributions which are normally invested in the unearned premium reserve (savings portion) is used to acquire fund units. There are life insurance policies which allow the policyholder to choose from a range of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>funds</A>, as well as policies which allow the policyholder to simply select an investment focus (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(619)'>bonds</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(465)'>equities</A>, real estate, etc.).
