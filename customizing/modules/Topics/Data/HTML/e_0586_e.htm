<b>Annual report / semi-annual report</b><BR><BR>
For each <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>fund</A> it manages, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(557)'>management company</A> publishes an audited annual report within four months of the close of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(644)'>financial year</A> and an unaudited semi-annual report within two months of the end of the first half of the financial year. The annual report contains e.g. the annual financial statements, the statement of changes in the funds net assets, the structure of the portfolio and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(654)'>auditor</A>s report. The semi-annual report contains the most important half-year results.
