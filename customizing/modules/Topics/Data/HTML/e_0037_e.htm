<b>Automatic adjustment of an insured amount</b><BR><BR>
This incorporates price increases into an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>insured amount </A>and a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A>. Changes in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(174)'>household inventory</A> index are monitored and an annual adjustment made to the insured amount to take these changes into account. The automatic adjustment of insured amounts is recommended to customers so as to avoid the potential danger of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(338)'>underinsurance.</A>
