<b>Interest withholding tax (Zinsabschlagssteuer)</b><BR><BR>
Since interest withholding tax was introduced on 1 January 1993, the custodian banks in Germany are generally obliged to deduct 30 percent of the interest revenue contained in the distribution (dividends are subject to capital gains tax), to retain this as a pre-tax deduction and to forward it to the Finance Department. Interest withholding is a type of collection tax which may be partly or wholly reclaimed by taxpayers by declaring it in their income tax assessments. For taxpayers acting as custodians of their own securities (in particular this affects investors who acquired their fund units on an over-the-counter basis), the deduction on the paid-out revenue is 35%. An exception here are reinvestment funds, which are subject to 30% interest withholding tax in all cases (for securities held by a custodian or by the owner of the securities).
