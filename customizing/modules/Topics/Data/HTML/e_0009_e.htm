<b>Old-Age and Suvivors' Insurance</b><BR><BR>
The old-age and survivors' insurance (AHV/AVS) has been in force since 1948 though there have been several revisions to it since then. Along with the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(191)'>AI</A>, the AVS constitutes the first pillar of the Swiss "<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(85)'>triple-pillar system</A>" and is designed to provide a minimum standard of living. It is compulsory for all persons living and working in Switzerland. Eligible persons receive old-age and survivors' pensions as well as allowances for helplessness and auxiliary measures. Rightful claimants are all either <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured persons</A> or their survivors. Special arrangements apply to non-Swiss nationals.
