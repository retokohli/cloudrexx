<b>Swiss Performance Index</b><BR><BR>
The Swiss Performance Index (SPI) was introduced on 1 June 1987 with an initial index base of 1000 points. The SPI covers all shares, participation and dividend-right certificates as well as the securities of 269 companies (end 1991) quoted on the Zurich, Geneva and BÃ¢le stock exchanges. The values of these 450 or so securities are weighted according to their market capitalization. In contrast to most other share indexes, dividends are added to the index.
