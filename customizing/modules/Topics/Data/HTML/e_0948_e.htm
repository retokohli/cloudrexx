<b>Fixed-date insurance</b><BR><BR>
Type of commercial insurance where a provisional sum insured is set at the beginning of the insurance year (= reference point for provisional premiums). On agreed fixed dates (e.g. the last day of the month), the insured person reports his or her actual inventory. This allows setting the effective sum insured for each period and settling the definitive premium at the end of the insurance year.
