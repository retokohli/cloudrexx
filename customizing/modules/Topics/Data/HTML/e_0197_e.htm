Period during which an insurance company, on the occurrence of an insured event, does not have to pay benefits from the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(378)'>commencement of the contract.</A> A period on non-availability should not be confused with a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(398)'>waiting period</A>. A period of non-availability is unique and is established for a stipulated period from the commencement date of the contract. At present, periods of non-availability are rarely met with in the field of life insurance (except, for instance, in cases of suicide).
