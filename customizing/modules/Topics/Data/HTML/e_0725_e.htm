<b>Competition of claims</b><BR><BR>
If a breach of contract also constitutes a breach of a general law, a claim for damages may be filed by the injured party under the contract and, at the same time, a claim for damages for tort. Both <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(19)'>claims</A> may be made but not cumulatively, i.e. if one claim is discharged the other will lapse.
