<b>Damages</b><BR><BR>
Damages are monetary losses amounting to the difference between the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(152)'>injured party's</A> actual fortune and his fortune as it would have been had the event causing the damages not taken place. In principle all damages or loss is taken into account as a result of the event, including any lost income which would have resulted in an increase in fortune. A distinction is made between corporal, material and economic damages. <BR> Note: the Road Traffic Act does not make the distinction between <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(245)'>corporal damages </A>and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(286)'>material damages</A>. In the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(311)'>RTA </A>economic damages suffered as a result of corporal or material damages are considered as corporal or material damages and are indemnified as such.<BR>
