<b>Pool</b><BR><BR>
With a view to increasing insurance capacity when particular risks are to be covered, several <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurers</A> come together to form a group or "pool" in which they contribute on the basis of predetermined participating shares. Any surplus or loss is distributed among the participants according to their shares. Examples are the Swiss pool for nuclear risk insurance, the Swiss pool for aviation risk insurance, the Swiss pool for damage caused by natural forces and the Pool of life insurance companies for <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(139)'>vested benefit polcies</A>.
