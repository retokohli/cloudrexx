<b>Parity</b><BR><BR>
Applied to occupational <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(390)'>pension plans</A> this term means that the administrative body of a particular plan must consist of an equal number of employer representatives as of employees, regardless of the total amount of paid contributions. The principle of parity must be observed by all registered private-law occupational pension plans irrespective of whether they pay out only the mandatory <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(72)'>BVG/LPP</A> benefits or benefits in excess of this minimum.
