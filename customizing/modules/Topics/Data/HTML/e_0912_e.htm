<b>Policy pledging</b><BR><BR>
It is possible to pledge a life insurance policy (e.g. as security for a loan). When the benefits fall due (e.g. in case of death), the pledgee (e.g. the bank) receives the assets. A restricted policy (pillar 3a) may only be pledged as security for a residential property for the policyholder's own use.  There are no  restrictions on pledging unrestricted policies (pillar 3b).
