<b>Legal council</b><BR><BR>
This council may be described as "second-degree guardianship". Recourse is made to it by persons whose economic interests need to be protected. As a result, their freedom of action becomes partially limited. Recourse should be made to legal council where a person endangers his own economic existence or that of family to whose upkeep he contributes.
