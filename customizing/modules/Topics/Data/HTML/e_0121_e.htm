<b>Disability (or invalidity) insurance</b><BR><BR>
In the event of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>disability</A> following the illness, accident or disablement of an<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'> insured person</A>, disability insurance provides benefits in the form of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(255)'>premium payment waiver </A>or the payment of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>pension</A> or a capital sum. Through a premium payment waiver, the insured person is, depending on his degree of disability, totally or partially exempted from paying premiums. The insured benefits remain entirely intact. Their payment commences after a contracted <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(398)'>waiting period </A>and they are payable throughout the duration of the disability, though only up to the expiry of the contract. Since the duration of a disability is intimately connected with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS </A>age, a premium payment waiver is as a general rule only granted up to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(314)'>tariff age </A>of 65 years for men and 62 years for women. A disability pension guarantees a replacement income to an insured person struck down by a disability. Here also the level of benefits depends upon the degree of disability. The waiting period at the end of which the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>insurer</A> begins payment of the benefits may be freely decided and could, for instance, vary from 30 days to two years so as to take the insured person's personal situation into account. The pension is payable as long as the insured person remains unable to exercise a lucrative activity but at the latest up to the contracted date. Here again the maximum tariff ages are 65 and 62 years. Where a capital sum is to be paid because of disability, the benefit takes the form of one single payment.
