<b>Value as new (VN)</b><BR><BR>
If an insurance policy is issued using the value as new principle then, in the event of a claim, cover would be based on current market prices. <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(175)'>Household inventory insurance</A> is usually based on the value as new principle so that if objects are added to it, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>insured amount</A> needs to be modified.<BR> With some types of insurance, the insured amount is linked to changes in certain <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(174)'>indexes</A> and is automatically increased from time to time.<BR>
