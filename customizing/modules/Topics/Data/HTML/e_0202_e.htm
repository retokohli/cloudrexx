<b>Preferred claim under bankruptcy</b><BR><BR>
Pursuant to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A>, beneficiary entitlements shall cease if the insurance benefits are pledged or if bankruptcy proceedings are instigated against the policyholder. The entitlements shall be reinstated if the pledge lapses or bankruptcy is revoked. An important exception to this rule is the case of a preferred claim under bankruptcy. In this situation, the life insurance policy is not considered part of the estate during bankruptcy proceedings if the primary beneficiaries are the spouse or the children. Thus insurance cover may be maintained for the family.
