<b>Occupational pension plan</b><BR><BR>
Employers with personnel subject to mandatory insurance are obliged by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(72)'>BVG/LPP</A> either to create an occupational employee pension plan - also known as an employee benefit plan - or to join an already existing pension plan. This measure demonstrates the government's intention to protect the capital paid into the pension plan in the event of the employer's going bankrupt and to guarantee its existence for the future benefit of the employees. Pension plans participating in the application of the mandatory insurance provisions must enter their name in the occupational pension plan register. The law allows pension plans to choose their structure from among various legal forms - a fund, a cooperative society or an institution based on public law.
