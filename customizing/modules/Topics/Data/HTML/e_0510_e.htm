<b>Commodity Traded Advisor (CTA)</b><BR><BR>
CTAs invest exclusively in <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(564)'>futures</A> and other <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(520)'>derivatives</A>. The majority of CTAs pursue a trend-following strategy. This acknowledges the fact that temporary trends do exist on the financial markets. Trend followers replicate a trend and stand to gain during both bull and bear market periods. A further strategy is to identify exactly when these changes in trends occur and to profit from them.
