<b>Risk factor</b><BR><BR>
Fact or circumstance which influences a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(144)'>risk</A> and which an insurer must take into consideration when assessing the real probability of an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insured event</A> happening to each of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(364)'>insured persons</A>. Objective risk factors refer to the insured object (e.g. the engine capacity of a car). Subjective factors take account of aspects of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person </A>himself (state of health of the vehicle's owner or driver). Factors are said to be progressive if they are likely to change or, alternatively, immutable where unchanging data are concerned (e.g. a person's date of birth).
