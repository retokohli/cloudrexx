<b>Endowment insurance</b><BR><BR>
Endowment insurance may be considered as the classic form of life insurance. In contrast to <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(325)'>death-risk insurance</A>, endowment insurance guarantees benefits not only in the event of premature death, but also where the insured person is still alive at the term of the contract. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> financing endowment insurance comprises a part which covers the risk and costs and an appreciable part serving as a savings element. This savings part of the premium is refunded at the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(316)'>technical interest</A> rate.
