<b>Surrender value</b><BR><BR>
Only endowment insurances which consist of both risk and savings components and thus generate an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(75)'>actuarial reserve</A> have a surrender value. The law refers to insurances for specific insured events (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A> 90.2). Part of each <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> paid for an endowment insurance is invested by the company as a savings premium which accrues interest. Another part of the premium is required for risk coverage, and an additional part for ongoing costs. The one-time policy acquisition costs arising on conclusion of the contract are distributed over all subsequent premiums, and are thus only discharged at the end of the premium payment period. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(8)'>General Conditions of Insurance</A> contain the rules by which the surrender value is calculated on the actuarial reserve. In case of doubt, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> has the right to request that the calculation be checked and verified free of charge by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(69)'>Federal Office of Private Insurance</A>.
