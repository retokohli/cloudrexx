<b>Upkeep</b><BR><BR>
Used in the sense of providing for the upkeep of a person "to a significant degree". In the context of the 2nd pillar or the pillar 3a, a person may be considered as beneficiary if the deceased insured person provided for his upkeep "to a significant degree". As a general rule, this is considered to be the case where the insured person, at the time of his death, had been providing for over 50% of the upkeep of the potential beneficiary for over 5 years. Beyond these limits an objective solution needs to be found on a case by case basis.
