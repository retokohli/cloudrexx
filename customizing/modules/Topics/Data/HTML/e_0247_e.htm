<b>Distrainment</b><BR><BR>
In principle, life insurance policies under <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(136)'>Pillar 3b</A> are subject to debt enforcement proceedings and may thus be distrained or considered as part of the estate in bankruptcy proceedings. If the spouse or children are the primary beneficiaries, the insurance entitlements may not be subjected to debt enforcement proceedings (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(202)'>bankruptcy privileges</A>).<BR><BR>Pension benefits under <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(143)'>Pillar 3a</A> and Pillar 2 (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(72)'>BVG/LPP</A>) may not be distrained before maturity unless there is a petition for cash payment and a reason for such payment. After maturity, limited distrainment is permitted, at the discretion of debt enforcement officials.<BR>
