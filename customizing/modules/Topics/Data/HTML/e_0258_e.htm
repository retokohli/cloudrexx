<b>Premium payment waiver (conversion)</b><BR><BR>
When payment of premiums ceases, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>insured capital sum</A> is reduced and any additional insurance policies cancelled. From a technical point of view, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value </A>available is considered as a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium</A> in issuing a new insurance policy of the same type. As a result, a converted, reduced insured capital sum is created and it is this that the customer receives at the maturity of the contract (or, where applicable, in the event of death). From the date of the premium waiver, the customer pays no further premiums on his/her contract. This form of conversion occurs either because the customer requests it or subsequent to a reminder being sent because the customer is no longer paying premiums. Condition: the insurance must have a surrender value.
