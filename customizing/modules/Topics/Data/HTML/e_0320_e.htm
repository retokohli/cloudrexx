<b>Temporary life annuity</b><BR><BR>
This form of insurance guarantees the payment of a number of pre-arranged periodical instalments on the condition, however, that the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A> is still alive. Payment of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>annuities</A> ends on the death of the insured person or when the number of agreed instalments has been paid. This kind of insurance can be financed either by periodical <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> or by a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium</A>. Temporary life annuity insurance is of interest to those who are only looking for benefits paid during their lifetime and income paid over a given period. An example would be the transition period between early retirement and the commencement of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHVAVS</A> payments.
