<b>Venture capital</b><BR><BR>
This term refers to the provision of equity capital and also comprehensive management support for young companies with above-average growth potential. The capital is typically tied up in the company for five to ten years. An investment in venture capital is not without its risks, as there is often no balance sheet or other key financial statistics available on the companies. The valuations therefore mainly reflect the future prospects.
