<b>Indirect amortization</b><BR><BR>
Method used to amortize a mortgage. Instead of direct amortization by means of direct periodical payments, a savings/risk insurance contract is created with a view to repaying the mortgage in a single payment on maturity of the contract, that is to say when the capital sum due at term is paid. From the tax point of view, the advantages and disadvantages of this method are debatable.
