<b>Excess</b><BR><BR>
Some insurance companies make<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'> insured persons</A> bear part of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>damages</A> resulting from an insured event, either in the form of a percentage or of a fixed sum. Excesses avoid insurance companies from being inundated with minor claims. Cost participation is a synonym for excess.
