<b>High watermark</b><BR><BR>
The high watermark is used in connection with the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(631)'>performance fee</A>. The fund manager calculates his or her share of the profits on the basis of the value increment over and above the last peak in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(614)'>net asset value</A>. As a result, the performance fee does not become payable until all losses incurred have been completely recovered.
