<b>Insurance policy</b><BR><BR>
An insurance policy is an insurance contract in which the rights and obligations of the contracting parties are stipulated. It merely serves to prove the content of the contract and especially define who is the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A>, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(43)'>beneficiary</A>. The document also indicates the amount of the insured cover, its term and the sums to be paid by the policyholder in the form of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> together with their due dates. These detailed indications are to be found in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(38)'>GCI</A> and any special provisions that must occasionally be stipulated. They form an integral part of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(251)'>policy</A>. When the cover arrives at term, the policy must be made available to the insurance company.
