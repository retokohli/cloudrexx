<b>Term life insurance</b><BR><BR>
In term life insurance, the agreed <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>insured amount</A> is only paid out on the maturity date specified in the policy even if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person </A>dies prematurely. Term life insurance is a cash value insurance. In principle, therefore, it also has a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value</A>. This type of insurance is thus also called fixed term insurance. If the insured person dies during the duration of the contract, premiums still to be paid are waived for the remainder of the contract. Despite this, the agreed insured amount is paid out in full on the maturity date. This kind of insurance allows funds to become available at a convenient date fixed in advance. It is particularly useful when combined with a children's insurance (education and newlywed endowment insurance).
