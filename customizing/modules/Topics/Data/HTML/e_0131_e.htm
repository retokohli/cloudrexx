<b>Fixed-rate mortgage</b><BR><BR>
Mortgage with a fixed rate of interest which remains unchanged throughout the duration agreed upon between a bank and a borrower - usually between three and eight years. During this period neither party may cancel the mortgage. The advantage of a fixed-rate mortgage for the borrower is that he can budget for the whole period and calculate the interest he will have to pay in advance.
