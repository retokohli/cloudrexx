<b>Unemploym. insur. a. insolvency compensation</b><BR><BR>
All wage- or salary-earning employees in Switzerland are covered by unemployment and insolvency insurance (AIV/ACI). Its aim is to indemnify an employee for any loss of income he may experience through no fault of his own (redundancy, reduction to part-time work, bad weather) or resulting from the insolvency of an employer. Unemployed persons are paid daily indemnities. The AIV/ACI is financed by contributions from employers, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS </A>and the unemployment insurance pension fund.<BR> The AIV/ACI contributes financially to combatting unemployment through measures connected with retraining, further education and reinsertion as well as financing <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured persons </A>who accept working outside their area of domicile.<BR>
