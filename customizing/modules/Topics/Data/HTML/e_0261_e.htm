<b>Premium refund</b><BR><BR>
Premium refund is mostly used in connection with old-age pensions. It implies that, in the event of the insured person's death, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> paid or the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium </A>(without interest) are paid out - after deduction of any <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>pension</A> payments already made - to the person designated as beneficiary in the contract's beneficiary clause. Premium refund also exists in life insurance. On the death of the insured person, the premiums already paid are refunded, also without interest.
