<b>Invalidity (disability) insurance</b><BR><BR>
Together with the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS</A>, the IV/AI invalidity insurance constitutes the first pillar of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(85)'>triple-pillar system</A>. As with the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>AHV/AVS</A>, the IV/AI is mandatory. All persons living or exercising a lucrative activity in Switzerland or Swiss expatriates working for a Swiss employer are covered by the IV/AI. The Federal Law on Invalidity Insurance came into force on 1 January 1960. The primary objective of this invalidity insurance is the rehabilitation of insured disabled persons. The latter have a right to a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>disability</A> pension once the rehabilitation period is over and when the disability has lasted for 365 days without interruption. The amount of a disability pension depends essentially on the degree of seriousness of the disability. For married couples, in addition to a basic pension, the IV/AI also pays out supplementary pensions for the spouse and children.
