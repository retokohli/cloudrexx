<b>Without having to follow metal tracks</b><BR><BR>
The definition "without having to follow metal tracks" is used to distinguish a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(224)'>motor vehicle</A> from a railway train or tram. Hence, vehicles running on tracks are not considered as motor vehicles in the sense of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(311)'>RTA</A>.
