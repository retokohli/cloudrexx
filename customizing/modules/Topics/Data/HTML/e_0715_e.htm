<b>Yield curve</b><BR><BR>
The yield curve represents the relationship between the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(601)'>maturities</A> of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(619)'>bonds</A> traded on the market and their yield to maturity. The yield curve is basically divided into three segments: a short end, a long end and a middle segment. The shape of this curve allows conclusions to be drawn regarding the current state of the bond market. Normally, the curve rises for longer maturities: the investor enjoys higher returns as a result of investing his money over the longer term. If the yields in the shorter-dated segment are higher than at the long end, this is called an inverse yield curve.The fund manager controls the interest-rate risk of the fund according to the positioning of his portfolio on the yield curve.
