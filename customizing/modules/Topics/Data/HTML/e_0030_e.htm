<b>Supervisory authority</b><BR><BR>
Each canton appoints a body responsible for the supervision of all occupational benefit plans of companies whose head office is located within the canton. This body checks that all legal conditions are observed and keeps an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(390)'>occupational benefit plan</A> register. These supervisory authorities are responsible to the Federal Council. Similar supervision is also carried out by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(69)'>Federal Office of Private Insurance</A> or the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(70)'>Federal Social Insurance Office</A>.
