<b>Beta</b><BR><BR>
A measure of risk which indicates the sensitivity of an investment, such as an investment fund, to fluctuations in the market, as represented by the relevant <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(494)'>benchmark</A>. For example, a beta of 1.2 tells us that the value of an investment fund can be expected to change by 12% if the market is forecast to move by 10%. The relation is based on historical data and is only an approximation. However, the closer the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(591)'>correlation</A> between the benchmark and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>investment fund</A>, the better this approximation.
