<b>Partial value insurance</b><BR><BR>
In property insurance, this is an alternative to full-value insurance that prevents a reduction of benefits due to underinsurance. The sum insured is set as a percentage of the full value, to be paid out in the event of damage. A partial value insurance contract is agreed when a total loss is extremely unlikely.
