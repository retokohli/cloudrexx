<b>Vested retirement assets (retirement savings)</b><BR><BR>
Within the context of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(50)'>occupational pension plans</A>, each <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A> receives a percentage of his <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(206)'>coordinated income</A>. These sums, termed <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(446)'>retirement credits</A>, constitute a person's retirement savings. The retirement savings are comprised of the individual retirement credits, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(138)'>occupational mobility credits</A> (termination benefits) transferred in from a previous pension scheme, and any deposits plus interest accrued on these amounts. Interest is calculated on the basis of the minimum interest rate prescribed by the Federal Council.
