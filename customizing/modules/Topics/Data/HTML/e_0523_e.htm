<b>Diversification</b><BR><BR>
Distribution or spreading of investments across a number of different individual securities, sectors, countries and currencies. In modern <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(635)'>portfolio theory</A>, diversification or risk distribution is regarded as a crucial factor in the reduction of risk: By spreading investments across a variety of securities, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(655)'>risk</A> is also spread, so that the overall risk of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(633)'>portfolio</A> is significantly lower than that of the individual securities. A broad diversification with dozens or hundreds of individual securities is only possible with substantial assets or with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>investment funds</A>.
