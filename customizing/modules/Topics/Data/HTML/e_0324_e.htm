<b>Survivorship life annuity certain</b><BR><BR>
Should an<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(325)'> insured person </A>die before the end of the contractual period, the benefit is not paid out in the form of a capital sum (as with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>death risk insurance</A>) but as an annual pension which continues to be paid up to the end of the agreed <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(105)'>term</A>. Hence the rightful claimant receives a replacement income at regular intervals up to a certain date. If he should also die before the term of the insurance then the right to the annuity passes to the person designated in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(44)'>beneficiary clause</A> or, where applicable, to his heirs. The life insurance company must, in any case, pay out <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>annuities</A> from the death of the insured person onwards. This is why their "value" can be calculated with accuracy and the beneficiary has the right - provided that the policyholder has made no provision otherwise - to receive payment as a capital sum of the discounted value of all future annuities
