<b>Triple-pillar system</b><BR><BR>
This is the name given to the Swiss old-age, survivors' and invalidity insurance system. It became part of the Federal Constitution (Art. 111) in 1972 and is based on three pillars. The first is represented by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS </A>and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(191)'>IV/AI </A>- a general insurance provided by the Confederation which guarantees a minimum income. The second pillar is formed by the BVG/LPP <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(50)'>occupational pension plans.</A> This cover, along with that of the first pillar, should allow an insured person to maintain his customary standard of living. The third pillar is formed by voluntary personal pension plans. This supplements the first and second pillars in accordance with personal needs. The third pillar is subdivided into <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(136)'>unrestricted</A> (3b) and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(143)'>restricted</A> (3a) pension plans.
