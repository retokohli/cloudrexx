<b>Delta-adjustiertes exposure</b><BR><BR>
The delta-adjusted exposure to an underlying instrument (e.g. the SMI) is equal to the sum of the weighted deltas (see <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(517)'>delta of an option</A>) of all individual <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(626)'>options</A> which are held in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(633)'>portfolio</A> plus all equity investments. This figure indicates the extent to which the portfolio as a whole will participate in stock market movements. If, for instance, a portfolio has a delta-adjusted equity exposure of 30%, this means that the portfolio as a whole will change by 30% of any movement made by the equity market. If the stock market goes up by 2%, the value of the portfolio as a whole will rise by 0.6% (30%*0.2% = 0.6%). Like the delta, the delta-adjusted exposure only remains constant when there are very small movements in the underlying instrument and is in any case only indicative since its value is largely dependent on the underlying and the optionÂ’s <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(653)'>term to maturity</A>.
