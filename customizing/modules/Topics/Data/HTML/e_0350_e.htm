<b>Withholding tax</b><BR><BR>
This is a tax levied on the return on capital (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(410)'>interest,</A> dividends: 35%), <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>pensions</A> (15%) and capital benefits from insurance (8%). Banks and insurance companies have to pay it directly to the tax authorities. An insurance beneficiary can declare the benefit in his tax return and the withholding tax is reimbursed. However, this process - payment of the tax on receipt of the benefit and reimbursement following completion of the tax return) varies depending on the cover since the beneficiary specifically states whether the benefit has to be declared or not to the Federal tax authorities.
