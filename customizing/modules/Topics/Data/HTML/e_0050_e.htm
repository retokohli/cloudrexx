<b>Occupational pension plans</b><BR><BR>
The BGV/LPP (Federal Law on Occupational Benefit Plans concerning Old-Age, Survivors' and Invalidity) lays out the regulations for employees' occupational pension plans - the compulsory 2nd pillar of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(85)'>triple-pillar system</A>. The aim of these plans - in conjunction with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(191)'>IV/AI </A>benefits - is to enable surviving dependants, the elderly and disabled persons to maintain a standard of living as close as possible to their previous standard. All employed persons subject to AHV/AVS contributions and with a minimum income fixed by the employer are covered. The main benefits provided by the BGV/LPP are payment of old-age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions and invalidity pensions.
