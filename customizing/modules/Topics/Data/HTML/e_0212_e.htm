<b>Defined-benefit method</b><BR><BR>
For <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(391)'>occupational pension plans</A> operating under the defined-benefit method, the level of contributions depends on the level of fixed benefits. The latter are expressed as a percentage of an insured salary or, more rarely, in francs. The amounts are calculated for different categories of insured person. The contributions used to finance benefits are calculated individually based on a formula using standard tariffs and the age of the insured person. Funds using a defined-benefit method apply the concept of surrender, subsequent payments in the event of salary increases or higher average premiums since benefits are usually based on the latest salary.
