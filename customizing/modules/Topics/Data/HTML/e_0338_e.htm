<b>Underinsurance (UI)</b><BR><BR>
Underinsurance occurs if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>sum insured</A> is lower than the value of the insured object at the time of the damage (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(118)'>replacement value</A>). The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> can reduce the benefits provided in the event of partial damage in accordance with the proportional rule (relationship of the sum insured to the replacement value). For total losses, benefits are limited to the sum insured. The proportional rule may be set aside if so agreed (first risk cover).
