<b>Premium (funds)</b><BR><BR>
A figure, usually expressed as a percentage, to indicate, for example, how high the issue price of a security lies over a specific reference price, usually the nominal value. A premium can also mean the amount (often also expressed as a percentage) a buyer is willing to pay for a right (option price, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(626)'>option</A>, subscription right) above the book value. For derivative instruments used for hedging purposes (put options), it is the price that the option buyer pays for the right to sell the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(493)'>underlying security</A>. In the case of the put options used for the Limited Risk Funds, the premium rises as market <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(655)'>volatility</A> increases.
