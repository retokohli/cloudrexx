<b>Medical examination</b><BR><BR>
In principle, a medical examination is always required when a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(20)'>proposal</A> for life insurance is made to cover the risks of death and/or disability. In the event of normal risk, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> is calculated for a completely healthy person on the basis of the following requirements:<BR>-    Good state of health<BR>-    Normal occupation<BR>-    Normal sports<BR>-    Normal place of residence <BR><BR>If the current state of health or hereditary characteristics of the prospective insured person depart from this norm or if any after-effects of a previous illness (aggravated <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(119)'>risk</A>) can be expected, then, depending on circumstances, premiums might be increased (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(97)'>abnormal conditions</A>) to take the higher risk into account. Up to a certain <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(23)'>insured capital</A> sum - which varies from company to company and depends on <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(373)'>age at entry</A> - the medical examination takes the form of a questionnaire filled in by the prospective insured person about their state of health. In some circumstances, the validity of the contract depends on the exactness of the responses provided (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(26)'>non-disclosure</A>). Where greater sums insured are likely to be involved either in capital payments or a disability pension, then the information provided by the proposer is no longer sufficient to evaluate the risk. In such a case, the insurance company requires a doctor's medical certificate in addition to, where necessary, further medical examinations. These are paid for by the company. The doctor sends the medical certificate to the medical service of the company concerned. The proposer releases his doctor as well as any other doctors, hospitals or clinics involved from their obligation of medical confidentiality. On the other hand, strict medical confidentiality is imposed on the medical service of the insurance company.
