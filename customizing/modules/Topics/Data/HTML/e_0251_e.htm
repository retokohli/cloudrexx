<b>Policy</b><BR><BR>
The policy is a private document setting out the rights and obligations of the parties which is to be issued by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA </A>11). The policy serves as proof that an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A> has been concluded and of its contents (VVG/LCA 12). It is not a prerequisite for the conclusion of the insurance, rather the outcome thereof. It is not a security, but is considered equivalent to a security for the purposes of declaration of invalidity (VVG/LCA 13).
