<b>Fixed sum insurance</b><BR><BR>
Fixed sum insurance cover is provided if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insurance benefits</A> are owed irrespective of whether the insured event has caused a financial loss and the actual extent of this loss. In principle, life insurance is a fixed sum insurance. The other types of personal insurance may be structured either as fixed sum insurance (fixed daily benefits, lump-sum disability benefits) or as <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(750)'>indemnity insurance</A> (medical expenses, actual loss of income).
