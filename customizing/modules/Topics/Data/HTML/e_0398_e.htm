<b>Waiting time</b><BR><BR>
A waiting time is a period of time between the occurrence of an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(364)'>insured event </A>and the date on which the insurance company is contracted to commence indemnity payments. A waiting time is applied in the area of disability pensions and where daily indemnities are paid out by a life insurance company. Waiting times offer the possibility of coordinating the payment of benefits where other insurance institutions are covering the same <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(278)'>risk</A>. A waiting time also allows the obligation incumbent on an employer to continue to pay a salary to be taken into account. Waiting time must not be confused with period of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(197)'>non-availability</A>.
