<b>Legal entity</b><BR><BR>
Legal entities are artificial constructs created by the law. They arise as a result of the grouping of natural persons in a legally prescribed form of organisation. Companies also possess capital. Legal entities have rights and obligations similar to those of natural persons. Examples include associations, foundations, stock corporations, cooperatives, limited liability companies.
