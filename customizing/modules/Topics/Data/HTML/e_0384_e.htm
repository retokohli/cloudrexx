<b>Full-value insurance</b><BR><BR>
<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(287)'>Insurance of objects</A> is generally considered as a full-value insurance. This means that the entire inventory of property must be insured at its full value (e.g. <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(175)'>household inventory insurance</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(153)'>commercial insurance</A>).
