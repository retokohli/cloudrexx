<b>Joint estate</b><BR><BR>
The marriage settlement of a joint estate comprises common property (capital and occupational income of the couple) and personal property of each of the spouses (personal effects and rights to compensation for damages). Common property belongs jointly to the two spouses whereas personal property reverts to the person to whom it belongs in his own right.
