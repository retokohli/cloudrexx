<b>Life annuity</b><BR><BR>
A life annuity is paid on the due date for as long as the insured person lives. The contract creating a life annuity must be formulated in writing. Life annuities are frequently referred to as deferred "<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(11)'>old-age pensions</A>". In practice, the terms are synonymous. However, a life annuity concluded in the context of pension insurance should not be confused with annuity insurance as defined in the Code of Obligations.
