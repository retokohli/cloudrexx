<b>Lombard rate policy</b><BR><BR>
A policy of loans granted against the pledging of securities as collateral is one of the classic instruments of monetary policy. Against the pledging of first-class securities, banks can borrow sums of money from the central bank (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(232)'>National Bank</A>) to overcome temporary cash-flow problems. The interest payable on such a credit is called a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(215)'>lombard loan</A>. By raising or lowering the lombard rate, modifying the level of credit or changing the standard of quality of pledged securities, the lending bank can influence the liquidity of investment of merchant banks. This in turn can influence the cost of credit, hence affecting investments and, ultimately, the wider economic climate. The policy of loans granted against the pledging of securities plays a secondary role in Switzerland, the main instrument of monetary policy being the buying and selling of currencies.
