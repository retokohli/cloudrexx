<b>Complaisance</b><BR><BR>
Adopted for commercial reasons, this is a method of favourable treatment towards a partner when, for instance, settling a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>claim</A> (awarding total damages despite <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(338)'>underinsurance</A>, to give but one example). The paying of a benefit for reasons of complaisance does not constitute a gift from a legal point of view, but is effected according to the<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'> insurance contract</A> provisions.
