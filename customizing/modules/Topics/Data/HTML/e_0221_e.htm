<b>Military insurance</b><BR><BR>
Military insurance (MV/AM) is based on the Federal Law of 20 September 1949 and is administered by the Federal Office for Military Insurance.<BR><BR>In principle, the MV/AM covers all health problems arising during military service. Benefits consist particularly of medical care, indemnities for <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(286)'>material damages</A>, indemnities for illness and disability and survivors' pensions. <BR><BR>Insured persons comprise essentially all those carrying out their military service and participating in rifle-range exercises outwith the service or training in military methods or taking part in optional events outside the service. A private life insurance company cannot reduce its benefits because of the military insurance benefits just as the military insurance cannot reduce its benefits under the pretext that a private insurance company is covering them.<BR><BR>In time of war or disturbances, on the other hand, this type of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(372)'>insurance cover</A> is limited.<BR><BR>If Switzerland is at war or engaged in hostilities resembling war-like operations, one single war contribution is payable by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A>, whether or not he takes part in the war. However, if the insured person takes part in a war or in hostilities resembling war-like operations without Switzerland itself being at war or engaged in hostilities of that nature, and dies, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(75)'>policy reserve </A>calculated on the day the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>insured person</A> dies is payable.<BR>
