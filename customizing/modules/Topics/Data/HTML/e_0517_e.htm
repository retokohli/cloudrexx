<b>Delta of an option</b><BR><BR>
The delta of an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(626)'>option</A> is a measure of sensitivity which indicates the extent to which an option participates in the movement of the underlying instrument (e.g. the SMI). If an option on a Swiss <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(465)'>equity</A> has a delta of 0.4 (or 40%), it gains CHF 0.40 for each Swiss franc that the share price rises and loses CHF 0.40 for each Swiss franc that the share price falls. The delta of an option only remains constant when there are very small movements in the underlying instrument and can in any case only be indicative as its value is largely dependent on the underlying and the optionÂ’s <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(653)'>term to maturity</A>.
