<b>Registered share</b><BR><BR>
Share in a company made out in the name of the shareholder or usufructuary. Ownership of the share is entered in the company's share register. This results in negotiation of these shares being more difficult though they can still be listed and traded on the securities exchanges. Opposite: <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(419)'>bearer share</A>.
