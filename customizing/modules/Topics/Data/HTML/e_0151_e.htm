<b>Global advice</b><BR><BR>
Global advice applied to life insurance should cover all aspects of the insurance of persons. It is no longer sufficient to simply sell "life insurance". On the contrary, life insurance can help to solve material problems and cover <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(123)'>costs</A> involved in loss of income in the event of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(207)'>disability</A>, premature death or the cessation of an occupational activity. Such global cover is achieved in Switzerland through the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(85)'>triple-pillar system</A>. This involves state institutions (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(191)'>IV/AI</A>), private companies (accident insurance, group health insurance) and individual <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(50)'>savings plans</A> (life insurance, health plans/health insurance, accident insurance and pension plans). These different elements do not fit together automatically to form a cohesive whole so that, in order to maximize the use of every franc paid in a premium, a close analysis of a customer's <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(390)'>insurance cover</A> is essential. This should take the form of examining current cover, establishing the extent to which further cover or savings is required and finding a solution which takes the customer's needs and financial resources into account. Advice given by a life insurance specialist is free and is strongly recommended in all situations.
