<b>Coordinated salary</b><BR><BR>
The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(72)'>BVG</A> coordinated salary is the part of the salary which, as stipulated in the BVG (Occupational Insurance), must be insured.<BR>The amount to be insured lies between 87.5% (7/8ths) of the maximum <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV</A> (OASI = Old Age & Survivors Insurance) pension (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(205)'>coordination deduction</A>) and 300% of the AHV (OASI) pension (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(806)'>BVG - Salary maximum</A>).<BR>To reach this coordinated salary in cases where salaries exceed the BVG salary maximum, the coordinated amount is deducted from BVG maximum. In cases where salaries are below the BVG maximum, the coordinated salary is deducted from the gross salary.<BR>If the coordinated salary is less than 1/8th of the maximum AHV (OASI) pension (with salaries between the maximum AHV(OASI) pension and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(812)'>entry threshold</A>), then it is rounded-up to the minimal coordinated amount.<BR>
