<b>Deferred pension</b><BR><BR>
In the case of private <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(446)'>retirement pension</A> insurance with a deferred start date, a specific (later) point in time is agreed upon when the insurer will begin paying benefits. In the meantime, the insured person builds up the necessary amount of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(769)'>pension</A> capital by paying either annual premiums, a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(94)'>single premium</A>, or a combination of the two.
