<b>Neutral banking transactions</b><BR><BR>
Banking transactions that appear, not on the bank's <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(0)'>balance sheet</A>, but on its profit-and-loss account. This contrasts with so-called interest transactions, that is to say operations on which the bank either pays or receives interest. Examples of the former are payment transfers, share dealings and currency and precious-metals business.
