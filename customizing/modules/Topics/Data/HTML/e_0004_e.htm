<b>Assignment</b><BR><BR>
Also known as cession. Assignment is a (written) contract between an old creditor and a new <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(158)'>creditor</A> which leads to a change of creditor as soon as the as-signment comes into force. This is also referred to as a change of policyholder. In the event of assignment, all the rights and obligations pass to the new policy-holder (third party).
