<b>Occupational mobility credits</b><BR><BR>
In principle, occupational mobility credits correspond to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(10)'>vested retirement assets </A>created when an interested party leaves his occupational benefit plan for a reason other than an insured event. The new law introduces the notion of total <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(137)'>occupational mobility </A>both for the mandatory part of a plan and the part over and above this. The whole amount of an occupational mobility credit - mandatory part and part exceeding the minimum - must be transferred to the new <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(391)'>occupational benefit </A>plan.
