<b>Surrender</b><BR><BR>
Particular method of terminating an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract </A>before it arrives at maturity. A <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A>'s request to surrender a contract results in its immediate termination. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> must then calculate the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value</A> and pay it. According to the law, the insurer must surrender life insurance policies for which the occurrence of the insured event is certain and premiums have been paid for at least three years. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(8)'>General Conditions of Insurance</A> issued by almost all insurance companies are more customer-friendly. Generally speaking, surrender may be arranged after just one or two years.
