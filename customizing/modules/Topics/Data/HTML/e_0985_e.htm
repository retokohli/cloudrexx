<b>Replacement costs</b><BR><BR>
In household contents insurance, these are indirect losses (consequential costs) from a loss event arising because of the need to replace insured objects (e.g. identification cards, credit cards, subscriptions, airline tickets). Household contents insurance assumes these costs up to the designated amount.
