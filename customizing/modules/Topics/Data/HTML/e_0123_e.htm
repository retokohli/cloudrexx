<b>Disability, invalidity</b><BR><BR>
As laid down in the regulations of life insurance companies, an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> is considered to be permanently or temporarily disabled when, owing to illness, accident or disablement, he is no longer able to exercise his customary occupation or to perform other suitable work which he could be reasonably expected to carry out. Work is considered to be suitable when it corresponds to the insured person's abilities and skills as well as his previous social situation. In the context of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>disability insurance</A>, the right to benefits depends on the existence or not of a loss of earnings resulting from the disability. For all persons exercising a lucrative activity, calculation of the degree of disability is based on actual loss of income. The insured person's earned income prior to the onset of the disability is compared with the income he would currently have - or could be expected to have - in the exercise of his former occupation or doing some other suitable work which he could be reasonably expected to carry out. The difference, expressed as a percentage of income, indicates the degree of disability. For persons not exercising a lucrative activity (e.g. housewives and adolescents), the degree of disability is measured by their inability to carry out certain tasks or the restricted nature of certain activities. Employed persons in particular should take care to ensure that, through the choice of a suitable <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(121)'>waiting period</A>, the legal or contractual duration of the employer's obligation to continue to pay his salary should be coordinated to end with the commencement of disability pension payments.
