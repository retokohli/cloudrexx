<b>Share index</b><BR><BR>
Index calculated daily following movements on a particular stock exchange. As share prices quoted on the stock exchange vary, so the index of that stock exchange varies, providing an indication of trends in share trading. Most indexes are subdivided into economic branches and sectors. The most important Swiss index is the SPI or <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(434)'>Swiss Performance Index</A> whereas the well-known <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(84)'>Dow Jones Index</A> shows trends in American shares.
