<b>Temporary accomodation costs </b><BR><BR>
In household contents insurance, these are indirect costs (consequential costs) arising from the fact that the insured person cannot use his or her own home (e.g. after a fire, water damage or storm). The household contents insurance covers additional expenditure for living costs (e.g. for a hotel room and for eating out) up to a designated amount.
