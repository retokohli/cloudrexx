<b>Premium deposit account</b><BR><BR>
The premium deposit is an interest-bearing account which is run free of charge and serves to finance future premiums to be paid on a life insurance contract. <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>Premiums</A> are debited from the account when they fall due. Should the balance of the deposit account not cover premiums until the end of the premium payment period, normal payments must either be started up once more or the deposit account balance must be increased. The balance on the deposit account may not exceed the amount of future premiums. Depending on the insurance company, a distinction is made between an irrevocable and a revocable premium deposit account. The advantage of the irrevocable premium account is that it earns higher interest, but withdrawals may only be made in specific cases. In addition, the interest is not subject to withholding tax. Interest earned must be taxed as income, and the balance must be declared as part of the account holder's assets. With a revocable premium deposit account, the account holder may make withdrawals under any circumstances and may close the premium deposit account. However, the interest rate is considerably lower than that which is applicable to the irrevocable account. Withholding tax must be deducted from the interest. Otherwise, this account is subject to tax in the same way as the irrevocable premium deposit account. Subsequent to the Federal court decision of 09.12.1994, the tax authorities may at any time request that insurance companies disclose details of all premium deposit account holders.
