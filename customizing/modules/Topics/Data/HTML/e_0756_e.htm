<b>Insurance for a third-party account</b><BR><BR>
As with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(755)'>insurance on the life of a third party</A>, insurance for a third-party account is an insurance for another person. With insurance for a third-party account, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> insures objects (property, assets) owned by the third party. The policyholder is obliged to pay the premiums, but the owner or holder of the object in question is entitled to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insurance benefits</A> (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A> 17).
