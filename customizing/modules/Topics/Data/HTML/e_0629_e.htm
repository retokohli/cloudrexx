<b>Performance</b><BR><BR>
Percentage change in the value of an investment, plus any accumulated income, and corrected for inflows and outflows of funds during a defined period of time. Meaningful <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>investment fund</A> performance comparisons are only possible over longer periods of time, e.g. over three, five or ten years.<BR><BR>Total return of an investment expressed as a percentage of its market value at the beginning of the period measured. Performance is composed of price changes plus reinvested income (i.e. dividend distributions in the case of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(465)'>shares</A> and coupon payments in the case of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(619)'>bonds</A>). Performance is always reported in the currency of the fund. For distribution funds, the performance calculation is predicated on a reinvestment of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(489)'>distribution</A> payments. The overall or absolute performance over 5 years (OP5) includes the compound interest effect. It can be computed using the following multiplication of the last 5 yearly performances (YP1 to YP5): OP5 = (YP1+1) x (YP2+1) x (YP3+1) x (YP4+1) x (YP5+1)  1 (all performance figures in %). The annualised or average annual performance (AP5) is represented as a geometric rather than arithmetic average and can be computed with the following formula: AP5 = [1+OP5] 1  5 1. For example, for an overall performance of 20% over 5 years, the annualised performance is 3.71%.
