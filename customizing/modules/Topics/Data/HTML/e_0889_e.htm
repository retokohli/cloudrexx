<b>Obligation to continue salary payments </b><BR><BR>
If, through no fault of their own, the employee cannot work because of illness, accident, pregnancy or maternity, the employer must continue to pay their salary for a limited period of time (depends on the number of years of service). The obligation to continue salary payments applies to employees with permanent contracts who have worked longer than three months and to employees with fixed contracts of longer than three months (CO 324).
