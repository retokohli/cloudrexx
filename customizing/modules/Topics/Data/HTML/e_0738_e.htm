<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(19)'>Entitlements</A> under a personal insurance policy may be claimed in conjunction with entitlements from other insurance policies, under liability or other legal relationships. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> has no right of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(272)'>recourse</A> against the liable third party. However, a part of the personal insurance (medical expenses, loss-dependent income replacement) is allocated to indemnity insurance under which the principle of compensation applies (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(725)'>competition of claims</A> and insurer's right of recourse).
