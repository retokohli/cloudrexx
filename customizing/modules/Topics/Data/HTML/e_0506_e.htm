<b>Buy-out</b><BR><BR>
This refers to take-overs of companies. The wellknown forms are management buy-outs (MBO), where companies or divisions are acquired by the management, and leveraged buy-outs (LBO), where new investors acquire the majority of a company using borrowed capital. Buy-outs are often used to resolve issues relating to succession of ownership of a family business.
