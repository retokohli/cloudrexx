<b>High-yield funds</b><BR><BR>
<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(620)'>Bond funds</A> which invest in bonds issued by borrowers with lower <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(499)'>credit ratings</A>. Such bonds offer higher rates of interest, but at the same time there is also a higher risk of default, i.e. that interest payments will not be paid or that the face value will not be repaid.
