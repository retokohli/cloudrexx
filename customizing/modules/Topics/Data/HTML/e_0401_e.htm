<b>Depreciation</b><BR><BR>
The value of an insured object depreciates with time and as a result of wear and tear. If stipulated in a policy, this depreciation is deducted from the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(234)'>new value</A> in the event of a claim so that the object is only indemnified at its <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(408)'>present value</A>.
