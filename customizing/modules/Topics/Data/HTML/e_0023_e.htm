<b>Non-disclosure</b><BR><BR>
Non-disclosure occurs where, on concluding an insurance contract, the person providing information (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> or <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A>) does not correctly represent, or does not represent at all, an important fact bearing on the risk whilst at the same time being aware (or being expected to be aware) of this fact. In such a situation, an insurance company is not legally bound by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(358)'>contract</A> if it chooses to revoke it within the four weeks following the date it became aware of the non-disclosure. These conditions are equally applicable to false information in the proposal supplied by third parties. On signing the proposal, the proposer certifies that all answers provided to questions in the proposal are true. See also under <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(147)'>medical examination</A>.
