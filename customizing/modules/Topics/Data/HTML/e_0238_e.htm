<b>Mandatory accident insurance</b><BR><BR>
The Federal Accident Insurance Law (UVG/LAA) came into force on 1 January 1984. This insurance is mandatory for all persons working in Switzerland except self-employed persons living in Switzerland and members of their families. The UVG/LAA covers professional and non-professional accidents and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(51)'>professional illness</A> and provides cover for medical care, repayment of medical costs and payment of daily indemnities and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(275)'>pensions</A>. A pensionable salary is considered to be the insured salary according to the Federal legislation on <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(9)'>old-age and survival</A> (AHV/AVS). Accident insurance (UVG/LAA) is administered either by the Swiss Accident Insurance Institute (SUVA) or by other recognized insurers. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> for the mandatory insurance are paid by the employer whereas those for non-professional accidents may be charged to the employee.
