<b>Occupational mobility policy</b><BR><BR>
If for some reason occupational mobility credits  cannot be transferred to a new <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(391)'>occupational benefit plan</A>, the credits may be kept through the creation of an occupational mobility policy.<BR>The occupational mobility policy is a special form of capital or annuity insurance under Pillar 2 which exclusively and irrevocably serves as part of long-term savings, including any supplementary insurance for death or disability. A minimum interest rate is guaranteed.
