<b>Insurance cover</b><BR><BR>
When trying to define what insurance cover means, it is necessary to find out if, with reference to a particular contract, a guarantee exists, and if so, what it covers. For instance, what risk is insured and what is the scope of the cover (objective scope), what persons are insured (personnel scope), in which countries is the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract </A>valid (territorial scope) and from what date to what date is the contract in force (temporal scope). When employing the terms "insured benefits" or "cover", the question should always be asked in what sense these technical terms are being used.<BR>Insurance cover becomes permanent when an insurnce company accepts the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(20)'>proposal</A>. Details of the cover are specified in the policy. Should the premium payments be interrupted prematurely, cover lapses in whole or in part, depending on the provisions applying to the type of insurance in question. In life insurance, the scope of the insurance cover is worldwide - contrary to most other branches - independently of where the insured event takes place. This is termed a "worldwide policy".<BR>
