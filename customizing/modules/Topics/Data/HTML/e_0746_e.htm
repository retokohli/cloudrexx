<b>Duty of loss minimisation</b><BR><BR>
After occurrence of the suspected event, pursuant to <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A> 61 the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(724)'>rightful claimant</A> must ensure that the the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>loss</A> is minimised or is not increased. He/she must obtain and follow instructions from the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> in this regard. If the rightful claimant culpably breaches these obligations, the insurer may reduce the indemnity by that amount by which the loss has not been minimised or has increased as a result of the claimant's failure to minimise the loss.
