<b>Surplus participation of insured persons</b><BR><BR>
Within the context of a life insurance contract, the benefits and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> are guaranteed for the whole <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(379)'>duration of the contract</A>. Care is therefore necessary when calculating the amount of the premiums and factors such as mortality, disability risk, changes in interest rates and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(207)'>costs</A> all have to be carefully considered. As a general rule, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(278)'>risk</A> trend and interest income performance turn out better than forecast. This is why life insurance companies offer <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholders</A> a share (participation) in the company's surplus as a kind of compensation for an overcontribution. The right to surplus participation is given after one to three years of insurance and  the policyholder's participation in the company's surplus may be arranged on the basis of different systems. The shares of surplus may be used as follows: <BR>- accrual with interest<BR>- increase in insurance benefits<BR>- reduction in premiums
