<b>Testamentary provisions with power of attorney</b><BR><BR>
For <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(87)'>life insurance on a third party</A>, a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> may designate the person who will replace him as policyholder on his death. However, his death does not result in the expiry of the contract nor does any <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefit</A> fall due. The designation of the new contracting party follows the testamentary provisions. The power of attorney which accompanies it authorizes the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer </A>to transfer the policy to the new contracting party as soon as the death becomes known. If no testamentary provisions are available then the right to the policy becomes part of the deceased's estate, in which case the heirs as a group become the new policyholders.
