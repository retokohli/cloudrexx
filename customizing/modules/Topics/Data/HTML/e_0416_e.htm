<b>Discount rate policy</b><BR><BR>
One of the classic instruments used in monetary policies. A bank in need of funds can sell high-quality letters of exchange to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(232)'>National Bank</A>, that is to say it discounts them. For the period of time between the discounting and the maturity of the instrument, the National Bank charges interest - the so-called discount rate. This is, in fact, an operation of rediscounting since the bank discounts its letters of exchange to private individuals. By increasing the discount rate, credit on letters of exchange becomes more expensive for banks, resulting in a tendency towards a reduction in the demand for letters of exchange and hence in the money supply. A reduction in the discount rate has the opposite effect. At the time of the foundation of the National Bank and for several decades afterwards, the discount rate policy played a fairly important role. As a consequence of the reduction in importance of exchange letters as a means of financing, the discount rate policy has taken a back seat in recent years. Changes in the discount rate often produce a decisive effect as, for instance, when the central bank (National Bank) indicates that it wants to follow a more restrictive monetary policy.
