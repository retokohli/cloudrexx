<b>Portfolio theory</b><BR><BR>
The relationship between <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(655)'>risk</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(540)'>return</A> is a key tenet of modern portfolio theory. In principle, a higher return can only be "purchased" for a higher risk. However, the relationship between risk and return may be optimised via a broad spread of investments (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(523)'>diversification</A>). By doing so, a higher return can be generated with the same level of risk, and a lower return can be achieved with a lower level of risk.
