<b>Hedge funds</b><BR><BR>
Despite the name, hedging transactions are not the primary purpose of such funds. Since these funds are aimed at generating absolute income, they make investments which conventional funds are not allowed to make (speculation on market declines, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(602)'>short sales</A>, use of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(520)'>derivatives</A>, financing investments by borrowing). This enables hedge funds to record positive <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(629)'>returns</A> irrespective of the market situation.
