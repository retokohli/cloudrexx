<b>Efficient frontier</b><BR><BR>
Modern financial theory sees the relationship between <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(540)'>income</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(655)'>risk</A> as two-dimensional, taking <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(629)'>returns</A> and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(705)'>volatility</A> into consideration. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(633)'>portfolio</A> return corresponds to the weighted average of the returns from each of the individual securities. The volatility of the portfolio is not however calculated as a weighted average of the individual securities' volatility, as the valuations of the individual securities do not correlate perfectly. Through <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(523)'>diversification</A>, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(477)'>investor</A> can thus reduce risk without having to forego returns. Due to the weak <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(591)'>correlation</A> of alternative and traditional investments, an existing portfolio is able to achieve a more favourable risk/return profile by adding alternative investments.
