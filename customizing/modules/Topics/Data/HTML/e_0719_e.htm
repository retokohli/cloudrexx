<b>Capitalisation rate (static disc. cash flow meth.)</b><BR><BR>
It is made up of the charges on a property (interest costs, fees, operating expenses, insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs, amortisation/depreciation of buildings, risk of rental losses, administrative costs) and is expressed as a percentage of the capitalised-income value. As one of the elements used to calculate the capitalised-income value, the capitalisation rate is determined by an independent expert based on expenses which are expected to be incurred in connection with the property.
