<b>Duration</b><BR><BR>
The duration represents the length of time for which capital is tied-up in a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(619)'>bond</A> investment. In contrast to <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(653)'>residual maturity</A> calculations, the concept of duration takes account of the time structure of returning cash flows (such as coupon repayments). The average duration of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(633)'>portfolio</A> is derived from the weighted average duration of the individual securities. The modified duration is derived from the duration and provides a measure of the risk with which the sensitivity of bonds or bond portfolios to interest-rate changes can be estimated. A 1% increase (decrease) in the interest level accordingly produces a percentage fall (rise) in the price in proportion to the modified duration. For example: the modified duration of a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(620)'>bond fund</A> is 4.5 years, the theoretical yield to maturity is 5.3%. If the yield drops by 1% to 4.3%, the fund price increases by around 4.5%. For bond and <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(475)'>asset allocation funds</A>, the duration is given for all fixed-income instruments. In specialist literature, modified duration can be found both as a factor and in years.
