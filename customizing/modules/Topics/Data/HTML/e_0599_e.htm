<b>Encumbrance</b><BR><BR>
The expenditure of a property for interest on investment capital, duties, real estate operating costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and repair costs, building amortisation/depreciation, risk of rental losses and administrative costs. Various properties may differ sharply from each other in terms of encumbrance, among other reasons due to the age structure and the related maintenance and repair costs, the type of building (residential or office building) and the tax burden on the location of the property.
