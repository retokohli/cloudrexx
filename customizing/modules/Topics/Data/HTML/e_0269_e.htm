<b>Raiffeisen Banks</b><BR><BR>
The Raiffeisen credit banks mentioned in bank statistics represent between 2 and 3% of total banking assets in Switzerland. They are public-utility local savings and credit banks which bear the name of their founder, Friedrich Wilhelm Raiffeisen. Organized on the lines of mutual cooperatives, they collect local funds which are then loaned under favourable conditions to persons seeking credit.
