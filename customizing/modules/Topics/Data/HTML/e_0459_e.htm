<b>Hedging costs</b><BR><BR>
These are costs that arise when a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(633)'>portfolio</A> is hedged against losses using dynamic or static hedging. For portfolios with dynamic hedging the expenses primarily consist of purchase and redemption costs for shifting investments between the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(511)'>Core Portfolio</A> and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(625)'>Opportunity Portfolio</A>. For static hedging the costs arise from the purchase of derivatives such as <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(626)'>put options</A>.
