<b>Umbrella fund</b><BR><BR>
An <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>investment fund</A> which comprises several <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(681)'>subfunds</A>. Together the subfunds form one single legal entity, meaning that only the umbrella fund needs to be submitted for authorisation. The subfunds are governed by the same <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(638)'>fund regulations and prospectus</A>. Once the umbrella fund has been approved, other subfunds can be created. Not to be confused with <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(563)'>fund of funds</A>.
