<b>First loss insurance</b><BR><BR>
In <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(929)'>property insurance</A>, this is an alternative to <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(384)'>full-value insurance</A> chosen in order to prevent a reduction of benefits due to underinsurance. The sum insured is set at a certain maximum amount (first risk), to be paid out in the event of damage. A <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(384)'>first-risk insurance</A> arrangement is agreed if the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(376)'>insurance value</A> cannot be determined in advance.
