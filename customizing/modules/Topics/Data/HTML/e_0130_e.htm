If the defect is the cause of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(289)'>damages</A>, the possessor of the vehicle is responsible for them, even if he is not otherwise at <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(351)'>fault.</A> This is referred to as (simple) <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(200)'>causal liability.</A>
