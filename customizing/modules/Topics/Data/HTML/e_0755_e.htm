<b>Insurance on the life of a third party</b><BR><BR>
With insurance on the life of a third party, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> concludes a life insurance policy on the life of a third person, not on his/her own life. Thus the policyholder and the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> are not one and the same person. Only the policyholder is entitled to the rights and obligations under the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A>, not the insured person. The conclusion of an insurance policy on the life of a third party requires prior written agreement from the insured third party in order to be valid (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A> 74).
