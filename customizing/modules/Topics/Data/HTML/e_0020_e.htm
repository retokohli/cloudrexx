<b>Proposal or application</b><BR><BR>
The application is the expression of will by which the applicant expresses his/her will to conclude a contract in binding fashion, such that a positive counter-declaration (acceptance) by the recipient is all that is required for the establishment of the contract. The application for concluding an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A> is normally initiated by the person interested in obtaining insurance (the potential <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A>). It must contain all objectively significant contractual points (insured perils, insured objects, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A>, inception and duration of the insurance) and any other points that either party considers to be significant. Normally an application form is used to make an application. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(38)'>GCI</A> are either included in this or are referred to therein. In the latter case, the GCI must be issued to the applicant before submission of the application, as otherwise the application is not binding. The applicant is bound to the application for 14 days from the date of sending (if a medical examination is required, this period is four weeks). During this period the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurer</A> may confirm <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(15)'>acceptance</A> of the application which will have the effect of concluding the contract. Confirmation of acceptance is normally effected by sending the policy or the invoice for the first premium to the policyholder. If confirmation of acceptance is received by the applicant with a delay or if changes have been made to significant contractual points, this is a new proposal issued by the insurer to the potential policyholder which the latter has to accept in order that the contract may be established.
