<b>General average </b><BR><BR>
An old rule in maritime shipping. <BR>A general average is said to be constituted when a loss arises from costs being incurred or another sacrifice being made for the purposes of rescuing ship and cargo from an immediate threat. The idea of a general average is based on that of a "risk community" and stipulates that the owner of the ship and the owners of the transported goods share the burden of the costs incurred.<BR>
