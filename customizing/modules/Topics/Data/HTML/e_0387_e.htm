<b>Reserves or restriction</b><BR><BR>
Particularly in personal insurance, an increased risk as a result of pre-existing sickness/accidents or a bad state of health at the time when the insurance is concluded may lead to a restriction being imposed; a restriction is a limitation in <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(372)'>insurance cover</A>. As an alternative to a restriction, an additional premium may be agreed. See also <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(119)'>aggravating conditions</A>.
