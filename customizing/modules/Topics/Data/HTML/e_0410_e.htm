<b>Interest</b><BR><BR>
Interest is the return on loaned capital, the price paid by a borrower for the use of the lender's money. It is expressed in fixed amounts such as Fr. 250.-. To simplify calculations and comparisons, a rate of interest is defined as the ratio of interest to capital expressed as a percentage. The ratio of earned interest to capital gives the yield.
