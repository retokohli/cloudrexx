<b>Partial waiver</b><BR><BR>
Reduction in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A> without simultaneous liberation of a partial surrender value. A partial waiver is adopted in cases of main insurances which do not yet have a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value</A>. This is generally the case when <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> for the minimum premium payment period are not yet due and have not yet been paid. The term partial waiver is also used to refer to a reduction in supplementary insurances.
