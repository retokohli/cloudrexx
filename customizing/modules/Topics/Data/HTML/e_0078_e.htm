<b>Deposit (safekeeping account)</b><BR><BR>
Term used to describe the placing of securities in a bank for safekeeping. The bank undertakes to look after and manage them. Valuables are wrapped up and may be sealed if the deposit is to be closed, that is to say requiring no administration (jewellery, documents, coins, etc.). In an open safekeeping account, the safe custody of the securities (shares, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(237)'>bonds</A>, etc.) is combined with their management.
