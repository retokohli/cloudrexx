<b>Old-age pensions (retirement pensions)</b><BR><BR>
Old-age pensions, also known as life annuities, are payable annually, half-yearly, quarterly or monthly up to the death of the insured person. In cases of pensions with refund, the beneficiaries designated in the contract receive, on the death of the insured person, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> already paid though not including interest and reduced by any pension payments already made. For old-age pensions without <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(281)'>refund</A>, paid premiums are absorbed into the insurance in the event of the insured person's death. To compensate for this, the insured pension payments are higher. Depending on the product structure, the benefit may be paid either temporarily or for life. In the event of life-long payment, the benefits will be owed for as long as the insured person lives, even if pension payments already paid out exceed the premiums paid. A old-age pension may constitute the only retirement income for self-employed persons or a supplement to the occupational pension of salaried persons. Periods when <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(435)'>AHV/AVS</A> contributions were not paid may be made up using private old age pensions. When they reach retirement age women whose husbands have died often find themselves at more of a disadvantage than men whose wives have died. This situation can be avoided by a old age pension on the life of the wife. In addition, privately-financed old-age pensions enjoy appreciable <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(305)'>tax privileges</A>.
