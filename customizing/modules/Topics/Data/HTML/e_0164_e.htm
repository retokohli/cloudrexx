<b>Winding-up of a matrimonial relationship</b><BR><BR>
This takes place when a couple separates - be it through divorce or death of one of the spouses - or as a result of changes in a marriage settlement. At the time of separation/change, sharing of the spouses' fortune should be carried out based on the marriage settlement (ordinary settlement by <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(116)'>acquest sharing</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(163)'>joint estate </A>or property separation) and any existing marriage contract.
