<b>Beneficiary clause</b><BR><BR>
The policyholder may make use of a beneficiary clause to specify who should benefit from the entire sum insured or a proportion thereof on occurrence of the insured event. A beneficiary clause in an insurance contract is thus a method of disposing over the insured benefits. A beneficiary clause is only applicable to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(246)'>insurance of persons</A> and is, in principle, independent of the law of inheritance. A <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> possesses the right to designate a third party as beneficiary (Art. 76, para. 1 of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(396)'>VVG/LCA</A>). However, this does not mean that the beneficiary becomes party to the contract or is required to pay <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A>. Nevertheless, where an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(364)'>insured event</A> occurs, the beneficiary is expected to assume certain obligations in his capacity as rightful claimant. The policyholder may at any time revoke a beneficiary's designation provided he has not renounced his right to do so (Art. 77, para. 2 of the VVG/LCA). Any <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(742)'>natural person</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(735)'>legal entity</A> or institution may be designated as a beneficiary. Normally the beneficiary clause is incorporated into the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(20)'>proposal</A> and hence integrated into the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(251)'>policy</A>. The <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(8)'>General Conditions of Insurance</A> also frequently contain a beneficiary clause which is valid if no other arrangement has been made. In the absence of a beneficiary clause, all <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A> are transferred to the deceased's estate. Since the designation of a beneficiary is decisive for the allocation of benefits when an insured event occurs and is also one of the privileges reserved by law for life insurance in the area of family <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(390)'>savings plans</A>, it is advisable to hold open, detailed discussion on the subject with a life-insurance specialist and to check from time to time that the beneficiary clause still corresponds with the insured person's current needs and wishes. <BR>In the context of occupational pension plans and individual linked plans as well as <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(139)'>vested pension policies</A>, the designation of beneficiaries is only legally possible to a limited extent.<BR>
