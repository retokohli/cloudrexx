<b>Tranche</b><BR><BR>
A fund or <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(681)'>subfund</A> may be divided up into several tranches, i.e. with separate securities numbers, which differ from one another in one or a number of factors such as distribution practice, conditions, or fund currency. However, all tranches of a fund/subfund are always invested in the same portfolio.
