<b>Guarantee of extended cover</b><BR><BR>
Some insurers offer their customers a guarantee of extended cover without charging an additional premium (also known as a guarantee of insurability). At specific time intervals, or in the event of occurrences specified in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(38)'>GCI</A> such as marriage, birth of a child, or becoming self-employed, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> may increase the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insurance benefits</A> without having to undergo a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(155)'>medical examination</A>. Restrictions may be imposed in case the insured event occurs shortly after the benefits are increased. If the in-sured person is unable to work, no benefits will be provided for the increased portion.
