<b>Benefits in the context of succession</b><BR><BR>
On the death of an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A>, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A> do not normally become part of the deceased's estate but are paid out directly to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(43)'>beneficiaries.</A> This situation may change subsequently where the heirs' shares in the estate are not respected. In such a case, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value</A> applicable at the time of death is included in the calculation of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(250)'>heirs' shares</A>. If the beneficiaries are descendants then the spouse, father and mother, grandparents or brothers and sisters have the right to the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(366)'>insured benefits</A> even if they have repudiated succession - because it was burdened with debts, for instance.<BR><BR>
