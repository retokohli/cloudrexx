<b>Insured risk</b><BR><BR>
An event against which an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'>insurance contract</A> guarantees <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(372)'>cover</A> (an accident, reaching a certain age, etc.). On the issuing of a contract, the event must still be uncertain as to whether and/or when it may occur. There must be some connection between the insured risk and the insured object. It is convenient to distinguish between an insured risk and a <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(147)'>risk factor</A>.
