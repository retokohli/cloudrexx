<b>Abnormal or aggravating conditions</b><BR><BR>
Insurance contracts may be concluded with abnormal conditions corresponding with a particularly high or abnormal <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(278)'>risk.</A> Abnormal conditions may consist of a reduction in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(363)'>duration of the contract </A>(when the age at maturity is lowered, the risk is generally lower and statistically easier to calculate) or an increase in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premium</A> shown in the premium tariffs. A premium increase may be adopted for the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(379)'>duration of the contract </A>or for a specific period. If the insurer foresees a future change in his decision on this, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(355)'>insured person</A> may subsequently ask for the removal of or a reduction in the premium increase based on the results of a further <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(155)'>medical examination</A>. It is also possible to gradually increase the death benefit. In this way, in the event of death in the first year of an insurance (to take an example), only part of the death benefit would be payable. However, if the insured person is still living, this part would increase with the passage of each insurance year. The nature of a risk may also involve the combination of various abnormal conditions. A final possibility consists of excluding specific risks or after-effects of an illness or accident suffered by the insured person (<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(387)'>reserves</A>).
