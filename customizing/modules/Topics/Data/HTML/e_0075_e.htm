<b>Mathematical or policy reserve</b><BR><BR>
A policy reserve is made up of the savings component of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(253)'>premiums</A> capitalized at the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(316)'>technical interest</A>. If the savings component of a premium is increased by any interest due - but not taking completion costs into account - then the term net policy reserve is used. By adding a reserve for future administrative costs to the net policy reserve then the inventory policy reserve is obtained. The policy reserve also plays a part in <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(279)'>risk insurance</A> since, for the complete <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(379)'>duration of a contract</A>, flat premiums are paid whereas the risks associated with death and disability increase with increasing age. This is the reason why the risk premium that the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> pays is too high at the beginning and too low later on in the contract period. So as to be able to meet their obligations, particularly at the later stages of a policy, <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(354)'>insurers</A> capitalize parts of the early high premiums in the form of policy reserves. When a life insurance policy is <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(283)'>surrendered</A>, then a sum equal to the completion costs which have not yet been absorbed is deducted from the policy reserve for the insured <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(278)'>risk.</A> The remaining sum is known as the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(284)'>surrender value</A>.
