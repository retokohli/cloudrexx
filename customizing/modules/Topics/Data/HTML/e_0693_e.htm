<b>Other funds with special risks</b><BR><BR>
<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(468)'>Investment funds</A> which, unlike funds in the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(692)'>other funds</A> category, have a special risk which is not comparable to the risk of <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(531)'>securities funds</A>. There must be explicit reference to this fact in the fund name, the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(638)'>prospectus</A> and in advertisements. The units of such funds may only be sold on the basis of a written agreement in which the special risk is stated.
