<b>Linked savings plans</b><BR><BR>
Linked savings plans (or restricted pension plans) are a way of saving for retirement which provides tax privileges. They are designed to supplement Pillars 1 and 2. Because the money saved must serve exclusively and irrevocably as part of long-term savings, this form is described as "restricted". Due to the tax privileges inherent in such pension plans, restrictions are imposed on their conclusion, structure and disposition of claims, on the basis of legal provisions. As well as saving for retirement, provisions for death and disability may also be structured and combined in accordance with individual needs. Recognised forms of this kind of pension plan include restricted pension plans available from insurance companies and restricted pension agreements offered by bank foundations.
