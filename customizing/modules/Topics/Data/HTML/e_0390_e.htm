<b>Savings plans</b><BR><BR>
1.Non-linked savings plans: these englobe all measures which may be taken in view to providing a financial guarantee for the future. Life insurance is a principal measure in this, but capital investments, purchase of accommodation and so on are also included.<BR><BR>2. Linked savings plans: persons exercising a lucrative activity who are subject to income tax may adopt individual savings plans offering additional tax concessions. However, the amounts invested in these plans may only be used for savings purposes. Hence, the tax concessions are counterbalanced by the restrictive measures applied to the establishment and structure of the savings plan as well as by the limited availability of the invested funds. A linked savings plan may be created either through a linked savings plan policy or by means of a bank savings plan.<BR>
