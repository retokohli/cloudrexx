<b>General Conditions of Insurance </b><BR><BR>
The General Conditions of Insurance (GCI) set forth in standard format the provisions of an insurance contract as they apply to all parties concerned. They form an integral part of the<A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(374)'> insurance contract</A>. Insurance companies must observe the Federal Insurance Contract Act (VVG/LCA) when drawing up their GCI. This act includes certain provisions which may not be amended by any contractual agreement and others which may not be modified to the detriment of the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(368)'>policyholder</A> or the rightful claimants. The GCI reflect the legal requirements very closely and need to be approved by the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(30)'>supervisory authority</A>, namely the <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(69)'>Federal Office of Private Insurance</A> (FOPI). This very strict supervision provides a reliable guarantee of an <A href='javascript:top.ladeErQuer(356)'>insured person</A>'s interests. Given that the GCI form an integral part of an insurance contract, policyholders must be provided with a copy of them in advance or, at the latest, before submitting his/her insurance application form. More often than not these operations are carried out separately. This is why insurance companies request that policyholders confirm having received and accepted the GCI on their application form.
